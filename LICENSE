You can do anything with this program and its code (but please don't remove this file), even use it to run a nuclear reactor
but why should you.
In that case I won't be responsible for possible damage and mishap, because i never tested it on a nuclear reactor (why should I, 
I haven't got a spare nuclear reactor lying around)

However i'd love to hear from you if you think this program/code is absolutely great and superduper (or just plain useful), or better
join my efforts to make it even greater.
